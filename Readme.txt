Update notes:

Version 0.0.1.3
	* Started change log
	* Changed "Current Hotkey" menu to "Help!" menu; use this first if you're having trouble (it should provide some basic, dynamic troubleshooting depending on your settings).
	* Allows a "custom" key to be bound to hold down a key of your choosing.
	* Allows you to select a "target" window, which the hotkey attempt to solely work in.
	* Allows you the option to attempt to allow AutoRun to continue when the target window isn't focused (won't always work, this is a known limitation and the reason this is an option).
		* If hotkeys won't work for a specific game with this option enabled, disable it for the original level of compatibility.
	* Allows you to choose a "chat" key.
		* Pressing this key will suspend your AutoRun/Custom hotkeys so you can type a message normally in-game; hotkeys resume when you press "Enter" or "Escape".
	* Hotkey menus start with the current hotkey selected.
	* Hotkeys suspend in the configuration windows.
	* General code/commenting cleanup.
	
Version 0.0.0.1
	* Initial release
	
=======================================================================

This code is being released under the GPL. I'd appreciate it if you let me know if you use this code for another project, because I'd be interested in checking it out.

Generic disclaimer: If the program doesn't work, kicks your dog, sends covert hit squads after your mother, or otherwise does anything you think is bad, I'm not responsible. I'm happy to help and implement suggestions, but at the end of the day the source-code is included and I am only providing you with this script with the hope it will make your life easier; I hold no liability toward its usage nor results.

Thanks, and enjoy.
